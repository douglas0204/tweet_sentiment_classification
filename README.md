# tweet_sentiment_classification (by BERT model)

This is a Kaggle competition project. you can refer to link for this Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview (Training & test dataset can also be downloaded from the link)

Project object: 
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter. 
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.
Thus, this project is aim to build machine learning model which can classify tweet sentiment, in order to seperate tweets into "real disaster announcing tweet" and "non-disaster announcing tweet" 



Machine Learning Model: 
Neural Network model by using TensorFlow library. 
Applying BERT model (NLP)



Test Result: 78% accuracy
